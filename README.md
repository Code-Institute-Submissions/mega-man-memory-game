# Mega Man Memory Game
There's been a lot of debating and ideas for considering my Second project. After considering my options, I decided to create a memory game inspired from one of my favourite Capcom game franchise called "Mega Man," which is known as "Rockman" in Japan. 

The First time I played the Mega Man 1, I was very addicted to the game, as I found it very entertaining, and the challenges on every stages of the game was worth playing it. 

The younger me always looked forward to the succeeding Mega Man game series. What I found interesting with the game is the theme of every robot bosses and their special powers. 

I put a lot of inspiration creating this memory game. Whether a fan of Mega Man or have just heard of Mega Man, I hope this game entertains you!
