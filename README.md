# Mega Man Memory Game
There's been a lot of debating and ideas for considering my Second project. After considering my options, I decided to create a memory game inspired from one of my favourite Capcom game franchise called "Mega Man," which is known as "Rockman" in Japan. 

The First time I played the Mega Man 1, I was very addicted to the game, as I found it very entertaining, and the challenges on every stages of the game was worth playing it. 

The younger me always looked forward to the succeeding Mega Man game series. What I found interesting with the game is the theme of every robot bosses and their special powers. 

I put a lot of inspiration creating this memory game. Whether you're a fan of Mega Man or have just heard of Mega Man, I hope this game entertains you!

## Project Goals

I wanted to create a memory card game for this project using a theme and characters that I felt inspired to use. After considering many options, I went for one of my all-time favourite game called “Mega Man.” Mega Man is a famous Capcom classic game, which is also known as Rockman in Japan. I was so drawn to creating a game inspired by the characters from Mega Man 1-4, that I chose 8 of them to be included in this memory card game. 

In addition, my goal in creating this game is:

* To attract users with the theme and look of the game.
* To create a game targeting Mega Man fans.
* To attract non-Mega Man fans to play the game.
* To create a 16 card memory game that includes 8 characters that can be found in Mega Man 1-4 game within 60 seconds.
* To inspire Mega Man fans like me to reminisce some of the characters of Mega Man 1-4.

## User Goals: 

* Completing all the 16 memory cards.
* Completing the game within 60 seconds. 
* To remind Mega Man fans of the characters in Mega Man 1-4 games (Mega Man Fans).
* To have fun with the game. 
* To play a game that has a different theme (Especially non-Mega Man fans).
