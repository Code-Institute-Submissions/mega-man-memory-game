# Mega Man Memory Game

![Mega-Man-Memory-Game-Logo](assets/photos/megamanlogocropped.png)

There's been a lot of debating and ideas for considering my Second project. After considering my options, I decided to create a memory game inspired by one of my favourite [Capcom](http://www.capcom-europe.com/) game franchise called "Mega Man," which is known as "Rockman" in Japan. 

The First time I played Mega Man 1, I was very addicted to the game, as I found it very entertaining, and the challenges on every stage of the game were worth playing it. 

The younger me always looked forward to the succeeding Mega Man game series. What I found interesting about the game is the theme of every robot bosses and their special powers. 

I put a lot of inspiration in creating this memory game. Whether you're a fan of Mega Man or have just heard of Mega Man, I hope this game entertains you!

# UX 

## Project Goals

I wanted to create a memory card game for this project using a theme and characters that I felt inspired to use. After considering many options, I went for one of my all-time favourite game called “Mega Man.” Mega Man is a famous Capcom classic game, which is also known as Rockman in Japan. I was so drawn to creating a game inspired by the characters from Mega Man 1-5, that I chose 6 of them to be included in this memory card game. 

In addition, my goal in creating this game is:

* To attract users with the theme and look of the game.
* To create a game targeting Mega Man fans.
* To attract non-Mega Man fans to play the game.
* To create a 12 card memory game that includes 6 characters that can be found in Mega Man 1-5 game within 60 seconds.
* To inspire Mega Man fans like me to reminisce some of the characters of Mega Man 1-5.
* To attract different demographics to play the game.

## User Goals 

* Completing all the 12 memory cards.
* Completing the game within 60 seconds. 
* To remind Mega Man fans of the characters in Mega Man 1-5 games (Mega Man Fans).
* To have fun with the game. 
* To play a game that has a different theme (Especially non-Mega Man fans).

## User Stories

* To play a game that is fun, interactive, and conceptual. 
* To play a game that is inspired by one of the Classic games that bring memories.
* To play a game that uses characters that I am a fan of.
* To play a game that tests and challenges my memory skills within a timeframe. 
* To play a game that lets me play repeatedly.
* To play a game that I can use as my daily dose of brainpower.
* To play a game that provides me instructions on how to play it. 
* To play I game that works on a laptop, desktop, tablet, and mobile. 
* To control the music or sound at my convenience.

# Wireframes 

My wireframes were all created using [Balsamiq wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/). I’ve individually created wireframes for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile versions. 

All my wireframes can be viewed here: [Wireframes](https://github.com/GlobetrotterG/mega-man-memory-game/tree/master/wireframes).

# Features

## How To Play The Game 

* The Mega Man Memory Game is a deck of 12 cards with using 6 characters. To play the game, the user must match 2 similar cards within 60 seconds to win the game. 
* For an additional challenge to the game, I added a number of flips to the game for the user to track the number of times they have turned a card. 

## Start Text 

* Before the game starts, a "Start Game" is displayed on the screen. 
* Once that's pressed, the game starts, with the background music playing on a loop and the timer starts counting.

## Timer 

* Timer has been set to 60 seconds to make the game more fun and challenging for the user. 

## Flips

* The number of flips feature was included in order for the user to assess the number of flips they've made within 60 seconds. 
* It's a fun feature to add as it challenges the user. 

## Music On/Off

* Is added for the user to control the music of the game and giving them the option to play the game with or without music. 
* This can be controlled by pressing the icon. 

## Win and Game Over Message

* If all 12 cards have been matched within 60 seconds, a "You win!" message comes out, and the game will restart once pressed. A sound effect can be heard.
* If all 12 cards have not been matched within 60 seconds, then a "Game Over!" comes out, and will restart once pressed. A sound effect can be heard.

# The Game Theme 

If this is the First time you've heard of the Mega Man game, you will ask yourself... Who is Mega Man?. 

As per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man#:~:text=In%20the%20story%20behind%20the,Dr.%20Wily%20as%20his%20partner.&text=After%20defeating%20a%20Robot%20Master,that%20Robot%20Master's%20special%20weapon.), here is a brief summary about Mega Man: 

>In the story behind the original series, Mega Man is a robot originally named Rock, created as a lab assistant by the scientist Dr. Light with Dr. Wily as his partner. Following treachery by Dr. Wily in which he reprogrammed most of Dr. Light's robots, Rock volunteered to be converted into a fighting robot to defend the world from Wily's violent robotic threats, thus becoming Mega Man.

>Though all incarnations of Mega Man feature unique stories, settings, and characters, they share several common features. All main Mega Man games released prior to 1997 are side-scrolling action platformers. The player character must fight through the levels using Mega Man's "Mega Buster"—a cannon attached to his arm—to shoot the robotic enemies inhabiting his environment. When Mega Man was released in 1987, the characteristic that made it revolutionary was the choice given to the player of which robot master to attempt first. After defeating a Robot Master—the boss of a level—Mega Man gains the ability to use that Robot Master's special weapon.

The First-ever [Mega Man 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_(1987_video_game)) had so much influence on my love for the game, and have even downloaded a Mega Man game app on Google Play. 

This game uses inspiration from a selected 5 robot characters from Mega Man 1 - 5 and Mega Man himself to complete the deck of 12 chards for this game. The background music, sound effects, and backdrop for the game itself have all been inspired by the game itself.

## Back Card
For the back card of the game, I used Mega Man's helmet as the picture which complimented the theme of the game.

## Game Background Photo 
The background photo was taken from the Title screen in Mega Man 2. It compliments the game, and gives that Mega Man universe vibe.

## The Mega Man Logo

The Mega Man vector logo used was taken from a link called [Sprites-inc](http://sprites-inc.co.uk/thread-1889.html) from one of the site members called gaemon. 

To make it more immersive and relevant to the name of the Mega Man-themed memory game, I added the text "Memory Game." This was edited using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). The text that was used is called "Squartiqa."

## Mega Man Cursor

On a Desktop and Laptop, I have added a Mega Man cursor to make the gaming experience more immersive and fun. The cursor can be found on 
[cursors-4u](http://www.cursors-4u.com/cursor/2009/02/17/mega-man-2.html)

![Mega-Man-Cursor](assets/photos/megamancursor.png)

## The Game Music

* Once the "Start Game" is pressed, the game begins with the background music played on a loop. 
* 4 other sound effects can be heard: 
    * When choosing a card
    * When 2 cards are match 
    * When it's Game Over 
    * When you win the game
* Selection of the music and sound effects have been carefully selected to compliment the game itself. For Mega Man fans, this will also reminisce their gaming experience when they are playing a Mega Man game. 

Music were downloaded from [khinsider](https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/megaman-2-original-soundtrack) and [101soundboards](https://www.101soundboards.com/boards/10834-mega-man-sounds).

# Colour Theme

* Choosing the colour theme for this game was mainly inspired from the colour palette's of both Mega Man and Proto Man characters. 
* Mega Man has elements of Blue, while Proto Man has elements of Red. 
* Colour palette for Mega Man was idea was taken from the color-hex link created by a user named [dunstontc](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/25174).
* Colour palette for Proto Man was idea was taken from a site called [diariesofanessexgirl](https://diariesofanessexgirl.com/retro-proto-man-color-palette/) and created by a user named [Joshua Margolin](https://diariesofanessexgirl.com/retro-proto-man-color-palette/).
* I've compiled all the colour palette ideas incorporated in the game from a site called [coolors](https://coolors.co/).
